The HeroesofPymoli project:

This is an analysis for an independent gaming company using Pandas Library and Jupyter Notebook. The task is to analyze the most recent fantasy game called Heroes of Pymoli.

Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. 

I generated a report that broke down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
The final report includes each of the following:

Player Count

Total Number of Players

Purchasing Analysis (Total)

Number of Unique Items
Average Purchase Price

The PyCitySchools Project:

This is an analysis for a city's school district. I'm helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. The task is to analyze the district-wide standardized test results, as well as various information on the schools they attend. I aggregated the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.
